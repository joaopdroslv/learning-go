# Learn Go (Golang)

Welcome to the **Learning Go** repository!
This project is dedicated to exploring and practicing the Go programming language through simple examples, exercises, and mini-projects.

## 📚 What You'll Find

- 📁 `content/` – Syntax, variables, control structures, interfaces, functions, etc.
- 📁 `examples/` – Small Go-based projects to apply learned concepts.
- 📁 `notes/` - Some notes that I find relevant (as markdown files).

Most of the annotations will be in the code itself, in the `.go` files.
